# Replication package for "Extending the Range of Bugs That Automated Program Repair Can Handle"

This repository contains the replication package for the paper 

> _"Extending the Range of Bugs That Automated Program Repair Can Handle"_, 
> Omar I. Al-Bataineh, Linas Vidziunas, and Leon Moonen, 
> currently under review for the Special issue on QRS2022 in JSS


## How to install

Pull the docker container from DockerHub or build it using the Dockerfile in the project root directory.

```shell
  docker pull linasvidz/extending-apr
```

## How to run

```shell
  docker run -it -w /opt/Bugs/ linasvidz/extending-apr /bin/bash
```

The docker container already contains the configured buggy projects. The configurations for the termination bugs have been generated by the ~Repair/generate_project.sh~ script.

To perform repair on a pre-configured bug, enter the bug's root directory and run the following command:

```shell
cd /opt/Bugs/termination/Adding_Subtracting_Zero_1_NT.c && genprog configuration
```
